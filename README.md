# **U-Net with KITTI Data**  
_Implementation of a U-Net model leveraging the KITTI dataset, with a VGG16-based encoder pre-trained on IMAGENET._

---

## **Overview**  
This project demonstrates the implementation of a U-Net with the following characteristics:  
- Utilizes the **KITTI dataset** to explore image compression and reconstruction.   
- Includes visualizations to assess reconstruction quality on test data.  

This project serves as an introduction to compact representation learning and unsupervised learning using neural networks.
